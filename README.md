## Election Audit Summary
This script can be utilized in many different elections. The county can be changed to city or state depending on the data provided. I would also recommend further analysis of the data to determine the percentage of the vote each candidate received in each county. Other script can also be added to account for information that is not in the current data set. These could be demographic or party data that could help with future polling or campaigning.
